      <h4>Total Carbon </h4> <br>
      <b>ABSTRACT</b>
      <p>Total Carbon is computed by summing above-ground carbon (AGC), Belowground Biomass Carbon (BBCI) and Soil Organic Carbon. <br>
        The Above-Ground Carbon (AGC) is expressed in Mg (megagrams or tonnes) of carbon per km<sup>2</sup>. It corresponds to the carbon fraction of 
        the oven-dry weight of the woody parts (stem, bark, branches, and twigs) of all living trees, excluding stump and roots, 
        as estimated by the GlobBiomass project (globbiomass.org) with 2010 as the reference year.
        The Soil Organic Carbon is the amount of carbon stored in the soil (0 to 30 cm depth), expressed in Mg (megagrams or tonnes) per km<sup>2</sup>.
        The Belowground Biomass Carbon (BBCI)is expressed in Mg (Megagrams or Tonnes) of carbon per km2. It represents an estimation of the carbon stored in
        the roots of all living trees. This carbon pool is calculated as a fraction of the aboveground biomass carbon stock using root-to-shoot ratios (R). It is derived
        from two main data sources: the global aboveground biomass map produced by the GlobBiomass project (globbiomass.org) and the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC, 2019). </p>

      <br><b>TECHNICAL BACKGROUND</b>
      <p>The total carbon layer is the sum of the above-ground carbon (AGC), the belowground biomass carbon (BBC) and the soil organic carbon (SOC), expressed in Mg (megagrams or tonnes) of carbon per km2. The AGC corresponds to the carbon fraction of the oven-dry weight of the woody parts (stem, bark, branches and twigs) of all living trees, excluding stump and roots, as estimated by the GlobBiomass project (globbiomass.org) with 2010 as the reference year. The BBC corresponds to the carbon stored in the roots of all living trees and is calculated as a fraction of the AGC stock using root-to-shoot ratios. The SOC is the carbon that remains in the soil after partial decomposition of any material produced by living organisms, as estimated by FAO and ITPS in the Global Soil Organic Carbon Map Version 1.2.0.

      <h4>Global Surface Water</h4> <br>
      <b>ABSTRACT</b>
      <p>Surface water affects many aspects of our world: the exchange of heat, gas and water vapour between the planet's surface and atmosphere. Water is the engine behind the distribution, movement and migration of Earth's plant and animal life and is just as essential for humans. It affects our capacity to grow crops and manage animal grazing lands, to run our industrial processes, to manufacture goods, it influences the movement of disease-vectors, toxins and pollutants, it generates energy directly (hydroelectric) and indirectly (thermoelectric), it is an essential part of our transport network, and forms part of our recreational, cultural and sporting world. The Water Occurrence dataset shows where surface water occurred between 1984 and 2018. Open water is any stretch of water open to the sky, and includes both freshwater and saltwater. The map displays water surfaces greater than 30m2 that are visible from space, including natural (rivers, lakes, coastal margins and wetlands) and artificial water bodies (reservoirs formed by dams, flooded areas such as opencast mines and quarries, flood irrigation areas such as paddy fields, and water bodies created by hydro-engineering projects such as waterway and harbour construction). This product captures both the intra and inter-annual variability and changes. The permanent water surfaces (100% occurrence over 36 years) are represented in blue, and areas where water sometimes occurs are shown in shades of pink to purple (0% - occurrence - 100%). The paler shades are areas where the water occurs less frequently. The map can support better informed water-management decision-making.</p>

      <br><b>TECHNICAL BACKGROUND</b>
      <p>TThe spatial and temporal variations in the presence of surface water are captured in a single product called Surface Water Occurrence. It is a measure of the frequency of the presence of water on the land surface over a given time period, expressed as a percentage of the available observations over time actually identified as water. The map covers 36 years (from 1984 to 2019) and records water occurrence in monthly time-steps. Some locations are underwater throughout the period of observation (100% of all observations are classified as water), others are underwater for a few months of every year (often for the same months each year), some are only underwater on an episodic basis, and some have never been underwater (0% classified as water).</p>

      <h4>Natural Areas (Copernicus Global Land Cover) </h4> <br>
      <b>ABSTRACT</b>
      <p>Whether you’re monitoring crops, modelling green energy installations or soil sealing, combatting loss of natural resources or just helping countries meet their Sustainable Development Goals, chances are high that you’ll need an accurate and spatially detailed map on land cover and land use. Earth Observation satellites, like those from EU’s flagship programme Copernicus, are key to providing such maps, at a global scale, with free and open access. Derived from the Copernicus Global Land Cover, this map represents the distribution of areas where land cover is not heavily disturbed by man’s activities. In other words, it shows areas where natural ecosystems and their associated species are expected to be found. </p>

      <p>This layer of Natural Areas is calculated using Copernicus Global 100m Land Cover map 2019, by aggregation of all land cover classes except ‘Urban/Built up’ and ‘Cultivated and managed vegetation/agriculture (cropland)’.</p>

      <h4>Intact Forest Landscapes (IFL)</h4> <br>
      <b>ABSTRACT</b>
      <p>The Intact Forest Landscapes (IFL) data set identifies unbroken expanses of natural ecosystems within the zone of forest extent that show no signs of significant human activity and are large enough that all native biodiversity, including viable populations of wide-ranging species, could be maintained. To map IFL areas, a set of criteria was developed and designed to be globally applicable and easily replicable, the latter to allow for repeated assessments over time as well as verification. IFL areas were defined as unfragmented landscapes, at least 50,000 hectares in size, and with a minimum width of 10 kilometers. These were then mapped from Landsat satellite imagery for the year 2000.
        Changes in the extent of IFLs were identified within year 2000 IFL boundary using the global wall-to-wall Landsat image composite for year 2016 and the global forest cover loss dataset (Hansen et al., 2016). Areas identified as “reduction in extent” met the IFL criteria in 2000, but no longer met the criteria in 2013. The main causes of change were clearing for agriculture and tree plantations, industrial activity such as logging and mining, fragmentation due to infrastructure and new roads, and fires assumed to be caused by humans.</p>
      <br><b>DATA PROVIDER</b>
      <p>Greenpeace, University of Maryland, World Resources Institute and Transparent World.</p>
      <br><b>TECHNICAL BACKGROUND</b>
      <p>The IFL mapping approach is based on ‘inverse logic’, i.e. on mapping the opposite of intactness: altered and fragmented forest areas. The image analysis was conducted through expert-based visual interpretation, using Geographic Information System (GIS) overlays of medium spatial resolution satellite images with additional thematic and topographic map layers. The purpose is to detect evidence of significant human-caused alteration and fragmentation. To assess fragmentation, all developed areas were excluded and all infrastructure and settlements were buffered by 1 km. Patches without evidence of development, if large enough, are classified as IFL. The IFL Mapping Team produced and provides regular updates of the global IFL map which shows the boundary between unaltered forest landscapes (where most components, including species and site diversity, dynamics and ecological functions remain intact) and altered or fragmented forests (where some level of timber extraction, species composition change, anthropogenic fragmentation and/or alteration of ecosystem dynamics has taken place). The IFL methodology represents a practical, rapid, and cost-effective approach for assessing forest intactness, alteration and degradation at the global and regional scales.</p>
